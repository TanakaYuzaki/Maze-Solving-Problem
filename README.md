This project is about creating a randomly generated maze algorithm alongside using BFS to solve it. I may learn to use A* in the Future but I am quite busy now.
This is just the temporary result
I have used:
-DFS (Generating the maze randomly)
-BFS (Solution)
-Matplotlib (Render)

Alongside with:
-Numpy (Generate number)
-random (Generate "randomness")
